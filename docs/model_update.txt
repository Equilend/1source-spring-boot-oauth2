Things to remember when adding a new version of the model:

1. Fix all the packages
2. Fix all the references to the weird LocalDate and OffsetDatetime. Change them to java.time package
2. Add this to OneOfTradeAgreementRate to allow deserialization

 @JsonDeserialize(using = RateDeserializer.class)
